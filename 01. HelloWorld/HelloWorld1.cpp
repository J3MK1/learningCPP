#include <iostream> 
//iostream will input or output data,for example, we can use "cout" command because of this library.

int main()
//main() means it is our main function/method, the main procedure we will work.
{
    std::cout << "Hello World!\n"; //This will output to the console Hello World.
    //cout means console output.
    system("pause>0"); //to skip junk text
}
